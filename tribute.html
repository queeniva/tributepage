                            <p>- Ada Lovelace was born in London on December 10,1815, under the name Augusta Ada Byron. Her father was the famous poet Lord Byron, and her mother was AnneIsabella byron</p>

                                - When Ada was five weeks old, her mother left Lord Byron because of his incessant drinking and womanizing. On the morning of January 16, Lady Byron and her infant daughter hastily made their way to Lady Byron’s parents’ house. A few months later, in
                                April, Lord Byron left England for good; Ada and her mother would never see him again.</p>

                                - Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the calculating engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called "Notes " Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, containing what
                                many consider to be the first computer program</p>

                                Ada was frequently sick and bedridden as a child. A severe bout of measles caused her to suffer from a form of paralysis, and by the time she was in her early teens, she could often be seen walking around on crutches.

                                By 1832, Ada has recovered enough to be able to live a more active life which involved horse riding and music lessons. She also received lessons in shorthand from a young tutor, with whom she soon fell in love. Her mother did not approve of the relationship,
                                and as a result, Ada ran away to the home of her tutor and his parents. She was, however, immediately returned to her mother’s care.</p>

                            <p>
                                In June of 1833, Ada was introduced to Charles Babbage, a man who would later be considered a founding father of the computer. Babbage showed Ada his so-called Difference Engine, a machine that attempted to perform simple calculations. Ada was intrigued
                                by the contraption and immediately started thinking of all the possibilities such a machine might entail.</p>

                                At age 19,Ada married William King</p>

                                When William King was made the Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada became the Countess of Lovelace, thereby giving her the name by which she would become famous. </p>

                                In 1843, Ada finished her work on the translation of Babbage’s lecture as well as her detailed notes on the topic, which ended up being much longer and more important than the translation itself. Her notes were categorized from A to G, the most famous
                                of which was called . Nowadays, the Analytical Engine is seen as an early model of a computer while Ada’s notes describe, for the first time, a computer and its software. This work d were many to accredit Ada Lovelace with
                                the prestigious title of the world’s first computer programmer.</p>

                                In the mid-1840s, Ada was often sick and bedridden, causing her doctor to prescribe her with a common medicine of the time called laudanum. Laudanum consisted of a mix of alcohol and opium, and Ada soon became addicted to this potent drug. During these
                                troublesome years, she also took up a horse gambling habit.
